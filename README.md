SCVim (> 3.5)
==============

A vim plugin for supercollider (tested on Linux and Mac OSX).

This is based of the original [scvim by Alex Norman](http://www.x37v.info/scvim/).

Features
--------

* Syntax Highlighting
* A faked REPL via the terminal
* Code Navigation (jump to definitions) via a global tags file "~/.sctags"
* Auto-Completion of known words via tag completion
* Launch the SuperCollider QT Help System

Requirements
------------

* ruby
* supercollider >= 3.9 (for current **master** - [Linux only](https://github.com/supercollider/scvim/issues/27))

Installation
------------

### `scvim` plugin installation

It is highly recommended to use a plugin manager to install `scvim`. Most
common ones are:

* [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* [vim-addon-manager](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager)

The plugin folder is expected to be found somewhere below `~/.vim`, at a
maximum depth of two folders and with the word `scvim` in it (which should in
theory cover all use-cases for the above plugin managers).

### `SCVim.sc`

If your SuperCollider version was not build with vim support (i.e. the class
`SCVim` does not exist yet), you'll need to either symlink `sc/SCVim.sc`
somewhere where SuperCollider can find it (typically that would be in
`Platform.userExtensionDir` from within SuperCollider), or add (the absolute
path to) `scvim/sc` to `includePaths:` in your `sclang_conf.yaml`.

Configuration
-------------

### ENV variables:

Path to the tags file
`export SCVIM_TAGFILE=/your/path` this defaults to `~/.sctags`

### Configurable VIM variables:

The following variables are available for configuration in your `.vimrc` file:

* `g:sclangTerm`: Command to open a terminal window. Defaults to `"open -a
Terminal.app"` on OSX, and `"x-terminal-emulator -e $SHELL -ic"` on Linux.
On some Linux systems this value may need to changed.
* `g:sclangPipeApp`: Absolute path to the plugin **start_pipe** script. Defaults
to `"~/.vim/bundle/scvim/bin/start_pipe"`.
Change it if you have installed the plugin in other location.
* `g:sclangDispatcher`: Absolute path to the plugin **sc_dispatcher** script.
Defaults to `"~/.vim/bundle/scvim/bin/sc_dispatcher"`.
Change it if you have installed the plugin in other location.
* `g:scFlash`: Highlighting of evaluated code
* `g:sclangWindowOrientation`: sets default window orientation when using
a supported terminal multiplexer. See Multiplexer Options for more info
* `g:sclangWindowSize`: sets default window size (percentage of screen) when using a supported 
terminal multiplexer. See Multiplexer Options for more info

Example `.vimrc` line for gnome-terminal users:

    let g:sclangTerm = "gnome-terminal -x $SHELL -ic"

To enable highlighting of evaluated code:

    let g:scFlash = 1

If for some reason vim can't find the path to the two launch scripts
**start_pipe** and **sc_dispatcher** you can set them manually in your .vimrc:

    let g:sclangPipeApp     = "~/.vim/bundle/scvim/bin/start_pipe"
    let g:sclangDispatcher  = "~/.vim/bundle/scvim/bin/sc_dispatcher"

Usage
-----
To start open a file with the right extension :e foo.sc(d)
Enter `:SClangStart` and a terminal should open with a running sclang session.

See the commands reference for general usage.

_ctags support_:

run `:SCtags` from vim or `SCVim.generateTagsFile()` from sclang

This gives you a couple of things:

* You can jump to any known class or method
* You get tags completion with ctrl-x ctrl-] (use the vim supertab plugin if this is too
  bothersome to type)

### Commands:

* `:SClangStart` launch sclang
* `:SClangRecompile` recompile
* `:SClangKill` what it says

### Key commands:

in normal mode:

* `<leader>sk` recompiles the sc library
* `K` on a word opens the corresponding helpfile inside the supercollider help
* `^]` jumps to a tagfile (this works for classes only so far but will be
  extended)

in normal/insert mode:

* `F5` to execute a block of code scvim will attempt to find the outermost bracket
* `F6` to execute the current line of code
* `F12` is a hard stop

Terminal Multiplexer Options
-----

Supported Terminal Multiplexers are 'tmux' and 'screen'. To use with scvim,
open the multiplexer before opening vim.  
For example:

`user@pc-555: tmux new -s sc`  
`user@pc-555: vim mySCfile.scd`  

Default settings for window orienation and window size can be set in
your .vimrc file. 

Window orientation options are "h" for horizontal and "v" for vertical. 
The double quotes are required. In tmux the "h" option will give you the vim 
window on the left and the sclang window on the right, and the "v" will give you
the vim window on the top and the sclang window on the bottom. In screen this 
behavior is reversed. "v" gives you windows on left and right, "h" gives you 
windows on top and bottom.

The window size option for tmux is the percentage of the screen you want the
sclang window to take up. For example: 

`let g:sclangWindowSize = 30`

The above option will cause your sclang window to take up 30% of the screen, and 
your vim window to take up the other 70% of the screen.

The window size option for screen controls the size of the vim window, not the 
sclang window. If window orientation is "h", the size specifies the size in
number of lines. If window orientation is "v", the units are unknown. A nice 
size to start with for "v" is 140. 

If g:sclangWindowOrientation and g:sclangWindowSize are not set in your .vimrc 
file, they are set to the follwing defaults respectivly:

tmux: "h", 30
screen: "v", 140

### Changing Multiplexor Options on SClangStart:

Options for the multiplexer of your choice can be set on the fly when you use the
SClangStart command. To do so, you must use :call before SClangStart. If only one 
argument is used you can change window orientation. If two arguments are used you
can change window orientation and window size. For example:

`:call SClangStart("h", 45)`

The resulting windows from calling this command will depend on whether you are 
using tmux or screen.
